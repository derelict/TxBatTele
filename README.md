EdgeTX/OpenTX Battery and Telemetry Monitoring LUA Widget which tries to rely as less as possible on radio settings (Everything is defined in the Script). So no need for "manual" Logical Switches or Custom Functions.

## Key Features of TxBatTele ‚≠ê

- **Current Sensor**: Monitor Current Consumption if a Sensor is available
- **Other Sensors**: Monitor and show other Sensors
- **Switch State Announcements**: Voice Announcements for any Switch Position (like Armed, Disarmed, Flightmode, and so on)
